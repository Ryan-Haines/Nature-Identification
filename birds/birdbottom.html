I started this project back in 1984, believe it or not, and am doing it purely for fun.
If you like this program enough to feel like showing your appreciation, please consider
<a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/about/membership.html">becoming a member</a>
of the <a href="http://birds.cornell.edu/">Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology</a>.
I have no affiliation with this fine institution; rather, I've enjoyed their lectures, classes,
and worthwhile projects over the past two decades.
