Readme file for object databases (flowers, birds, etc)

By editing the HTML files enclosed and creating a data.txt file, you can set up perl CGI scripts that allow access to this data, both for identification and for having questions about the data made up automatically.

Here is the manifest:

readme_bird.txt - this file

Perl script which creates the relevant files to put on the web; run by "perl generate_pages.pl":
generate_pages.pl - perl script which reads the data.txt file, related HTML headers and footers, and generates 3 files: an identification HTML page, a quiz HTML page, and a CGI script.

Input files:
birddata.txt - the database: specifies characteristics, birds, etc.
birdtop.html - top of the identification HTML page.
birdquiztop.html - top of the quiz HTML page.
generic_db.pl - input file; the first part of the CGI perl script above.
bottom.html - bottom of the identification and quiz HTML page.

Don't edit these, as they're generated by generate_pages.pl:
birds.html - HTML identification page generated by generate_pages.pl.
birdquiz.html - HTML quiz introduction page generated by generate_pages.pl.
birds.cgi - CGI perl script for doing everything, generated by generate_pages.pl.

----

The basic idea is that you edit the input files, run generate_pages.pl, then put the generated files on the web.

generate_pages.pl can also be run by:

	perl generate_pages.pl bird

or

	perl generate_pages.pl flwr

etc. The argument "flwr", "bird", etc, is the first four characters of the database file flwrdata.txt, birddata.txt, etc.
