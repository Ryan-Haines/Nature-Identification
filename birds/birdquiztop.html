<h1>Bird Quiz</h1>

This page lets you set up a quiz about birds that you can take. You can tailor it to your particular preferences, or just hit "Create a Quiz"
and take a general test. There are also quiz programs for <a href="../trees/treequiz.html">trees</a> and <a href="../flowers/flowerquiz.html">flowers</a>. The quizzes here are randomly generated by computer; for more professional and straightforward quizzes, see <a href="http://www.northbirding.com/idtraining/">Keith Saylor's excellent site</a>.
<P>
If you are more interested in identifying birds, see the <a href="birds.html">bird identification page</a>.
