This is an identification program for wildflowers in the northeastern and north-central parts of United States and adjacent Canada (if you live on the West Coast, try <a href="http://www.renyswildflowers.com/color.html">Reny's Wildflowers</a>). Fill out the form as best as you can and you'll find which wildflowers match. If you find
no flowers that match, use the "Back" button and try unchecking a box or two. If you want to
see all the flowers in the database, simply hit "Identify" without checking any boxes.
<P>
To understand more about the various flower terms used, see <a href="http://www.skyways.org/orgs/fordco/wildflowers/a-ff/byb.html">Fred's Flower Finder</a> (after reading the page click on the link at the bottom).
There are a number of sites dedicated to wildflower identification, including

Lee Dunbar has written a free <b><a href="flowerprog.zip">standalone version</a></b> of this wildflower program.
A <b><a href="flowerquiz.html">Wildflower Quiz Program</a></b> is also available, which lets you test and improve your knowledge.
There are also identification programs for <b><a href="../trees/trees.html">trees</a></b> and <b><a href="../birds/birds.html">birds</a></b>.

<B>Note:</B> This wildflower database is not all-encompassing; it contains only about 550 of the estimated 5000
species of wildflowers native to the northeastern quarter of the continent. If you find any
errors or want to add more flowers, <a href="mailto:erich@acm.org">write me</a>.
The <a href="flowers.zip">database and perl program</a> that runs here is free to download, and is fairly simple to figure out where and how to add wildflowers.
