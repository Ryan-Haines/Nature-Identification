I started this project back in 1984, believe it or not, and am doing it purely for fun.
If you like this program enough to feel like showing your appreciation, please consider
<a href="http://www.plantations.cornell.edu/gifts/members.cfm">becoming a member</a> or
<a href="http://www.plantations.cornell.edu/gifts/onlinegifts.cfm">giving a tax-deductible charitable contribution</a>
to the <a href="http://www.plantations.cornell.edu/">Cornell Plantations</a>.
I have no affiliation with this fine institution; rather, I was married many years ago
in their beautiful herb garden.
